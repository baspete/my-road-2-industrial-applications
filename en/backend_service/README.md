## Backend service

Any application would be backed by a backend service written in Java/NodeJS/Go or any other language. I'm not talking about [firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as of now for the sake of this tutorial.

My language of preference is Java, hence all my backend code would be in Java written using [Spring](http://spring.io/)  & [Spring boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

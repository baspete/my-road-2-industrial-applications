# The What ?

If you haven't already read about 12Factor apps, Please read [it](http://12factor.net/) first.

By now, I believe you might have gone through them and might have some idea on what it means to build a web apps, or software-as-a-service.

I'm not going to write a lot on the 12Factor apps here. There are already alot of great documentation about this.

Jotting down a couple of references below.

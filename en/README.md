# Road to Industrial Application

Congratulations, Looks like you are going to build the next Industrial Application on [Predix](https://www.predix.io). So where do you start ?

If you don't have an account, Try adding yourself to the [wait list here](https://www.predix.io/registration). 

Now that you have an account, Its time to build the application, But wait where do you start ?

## Pushing a Angular TODO MVC App

Now that you know about manifest.yml and how to work with them, Let's take this application one step above

##Problem statement
I don't ship one HTML page. I build application using Some Framework.

## Answer
For this exercise, I'm building a TO-DO app written in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

Tell you frankly, I'm not going to code the whole thing, I'll be copying the code over from [Angular todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/angularjs), Thanks to @tastejs

## What changed
Pushing a purely front-end  application with no backed tied to it, Solely  relying on [Localstorage](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp)
